// Notice that it doesn't actually uses git clone. Read if you want to.
//
// Writing this simple function took me more than a day. Here are the main whys:
//
// 1) If we used `git clone https://${user.token}@github.com/${repo.ownerLogin}/${repo.name}`,
// it would save the token in the .git.config.
//
// 2) If we used git clone with only the username (so, it wouldn't save the password / token
// in .git files), it would request the password via user input. I didn't find out a way to
// automatically inputs the password (= token) when requested by git clone, using childProcess
// (probably using .spawn() instead of .exec() and using some Stream STDIN sorcery that I didnt find out).
// Also, I ain't sure of how it would works if user already already logged via git --global credential.
// Didn't want to find out. I really don't like using git via cli (or any program at all). Not in the mood.
//
// 3) I didn't want to get the user's username and password, like the vscode does. We have a token, right?
// Don't make too much sense not using it.
//
// Links for the solution:
// 1) https://serverfault.com/a/815145 -> The answer command required mkdir and cd, and I don't know
// if it would work properly in windows the same way. I found out that git init <path> creates a dir.
//
// 2) https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/30i3we/git_pull_to_a_different_directory_other_than/cpsncul?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
// -> We can pull to a specific path using git -C <path> pull <...>
//
// After those two, the pulled repo don't have a remote (github link). So we add it.
